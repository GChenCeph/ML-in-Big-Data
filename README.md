# ML in Big Data

Our project taps into the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting wildfire risks with higher accuracy. By integrating diverse environmental data points such as temperature variations, precipitation patterns, soil moisture levels, and historical fire occurrences, we aim to build a comprehensive model that offers an insightful understanding of the conditions leading to wildfires.This initiative not only aims to enhance the predictive capabilities but also to empower decision-makers with actionable insights. The model can serve as an early warning system, enabling forest departments and emergency response teams to deploy resources more effectively, plan evacuation routes, and initiate fire containment strategies promptly. Moreover, it can aid in long-term environmental planning and policy-making, helping to design sustainable practices that reduce the risk of future wildfires.
